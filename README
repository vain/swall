                                 =====


A simple Xrandr-aware program to set your wallpaper. It handles common
cases reasonably without forcing you to specify a lot of command line
options.

swall is pretty much feature complete. If you need more options, have a
look at ttzhou's setroot:

Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - imlib2
    - Xlib

There are no compile-time options. Just run make:

    $ make

There is no "install" target.


Running
-------

swall assumes that it can directly alter the root window. In other
words, it's not supported to use a separate program that manages a
"desktop window".

Call the program with one or more images as arguments:

    $ swall tile.gif
    $ swall sparrows.png
    $ swall left.png center.png right.png

The first image goes to the first monitor, the second one to the second
monitor, and so on. If an image is "small" (less than 60% of the
monitor's size), then it will be tiled. Otherwise, it will be resized
in an attempt to fill the monitor.
