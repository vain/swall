                                 =====


A simple Xrandr-aware program to set your wallpaper. It handles common
cases reasonably without forcing you to specify a lot of command line
options.

swall is pretty much feature complete. If you need more options, have a
look at ttzhou's setroot:

Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - imlib2
    - Xlib

There are no compile-time options. Just run make:

    $ make

There is no "install" target.


Running
-------

swall assumes that it can directly alter the root window. In other
words, you're not supposed to use a separate program that manages a
"desktop window".

The program handles three common cases:

    $ swall tile.gif

        If the image is smaller than your smallest monitor, it will be
        used as a tile. To trigger tile mode, only one image must be
        specified and it will be used for all monitors.

    $ swall sparrows.png

        If the image is at least as large as your smallest monitor, it
        will be used as a wallpaper for each monitor. If necessary, will
        be changed in size to achieve the monitor's aspect ratio. Only
        one image must be specified to trigger this mode.

    $ swall left.png middle.png center.png

        If more than one image is specified, each monitor gets a
        different wallpaper. If needed, image sizes will be reduced or
        increased to achieve the monitor's aspect ratio.
