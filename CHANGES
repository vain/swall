Release history for swall

  [Changed]
  - We now decide on a per-monitor basis whether an image will be tiled
    or scaled. This further simplifies the command line interface and
    allows for different tiles per monitor.
  - The threshold to detect tiles has been lowered to 60% of the
    monitor's size.
  - Images smaller than a monitor (but large enough not to be tiled)
    will now be resized to fully cover that monitor's area. In other
    words, there are no black bars anymore.

v17.10  2017-10-10
  - Initial release.
  - Set root wallpaper and handle the three most common cases.
